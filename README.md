The purpose of the tire purchase model is to two-fold. The primary objective is to develop an effective predictor of consumers likely in need of tire replacement for their car, truck, or van. The secondary objective is to develop a model that can be applied to a broader range of targets to create scale in the marketing promotion of tires. 

Successful tire purchase models are lacking primarily due to the dependency on data collected during previous service visits. The automotive repair industry currently utilizes tire tread depth measurements (tire wear) or last tire purchase date in a time-based algorithm to determine likely candidates for tire purchase offers. There are many problems with the wear-based/time-based approach. 

The wear-based approach relies upon the consumer visiting the business location and the repair technician recording tire tread depth accurately. Often, this process is skipped during the service visit and is not entered into point of sale systems. 

The timing-based approach has its limitations due to the fact it relies upon the last purchase date of the current tires. Information such as mileage driven and tire specifications (longevity) are important data points but seldom captured during the service visit just like tread depth measurements. More importantly, both methods do not provide ample scale. Most customers who visit a particular auto service and tire retailer have not previously done business with them. This means as much as 75% of the customer base is left out of targeting tire promotions. 

The company believes a LOGIT model is the correct approach to solving this problem and that an effective model can be developed utilizing newly available data sets which can be applied to customers and non-customers alike. Identification of key explanatory/predictive variables will involve significant use of cross tabs,\ and difference/correlation testing. These data sets should increase the overall strength of the model while delivering on the scale objective due to the fact they are universally applicable. 

The sample data available for the project includes recent purchasers of two or more tires for a vehicle（purchaser’s information: features）. Tire purchase is the dependent variable in the model(s). No personally identifiable data is available. The purchase records include pertinent transaction data and vehicle information. 3rd party data will also be applied to each record. The 3rd party data comes from two different sources. The modeler should investigate a two model approach to determine the benefits of the 3rd party data in addition to transaction data.
